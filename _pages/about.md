Hi, I'm **Gokul**, a Dual Degree student in [Engineering Design](https://ed.iitm.ac.in/) with a specialization in Robotics at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. I'm interested in developing Learning and Control based solutions for Robotic Challenges. To achieve this, I have gathered knowledge in Reinforcement Learning, Control Engineering, Deep Learning, Motion Planning and Embedded Systems. 

I have worked on and continue to engage in various projects, including **Koopman Operators** for controlling dynamical systems under the guidance of [Prof. Anuj Tiwari](https://mech.iitm.ac.in/profile.php?fname=anujt), **Quadruped Locomotion** on uneven terrains, Learning-based approaches for **Bimanual Robot Manipulation** at [HIRO Lab](https://iisc-hiro.github.io/) under [Prof. Ravi Prakash](https://ravipr009.github.io/), and Centralized Multi-Agent RL for **Swarm Navigation**.
