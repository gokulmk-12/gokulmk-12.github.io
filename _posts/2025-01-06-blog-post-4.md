This post is on some common embedded communication protocols and their detailed description.

There are a few communication protocols that we need to know for building most electronic projects. Out of these, we will look into the basic protocols: **SPI**, **I2C** and **UART**.

> SPI, I2C and UART are quite slower than protocols like USB, Ethernet, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, but are lot simpler and use less hardware. SPI, I2C and UART are ideal for commuication where large amounts of high speed data don't need to be transferred.

## Data Communication Types
There are 2 broad data communication types based on how things are connected

### 1. Parallel Commuication
* All bits of data are transmitted simultaneously on seperate comms line. In order to transmit n bit, n wires are used
* More costly and is only used for short distances, but faster than serial communication.
* **Example**: Printers, Hard disks

### 2. Serial Commuication
* All bits of data are transmitted serially one by one on single communication line between the sender and reciever.
* Less costly and is used for long distance transmissions.
* **Example**: Telephone

Serial communication uses two methods
* **Asynchronous Serial**
  - Transfers single byte at a time.
  - No need of clock signal
  - **Example:** UART (Universal Asynchronous Reciever Transmitter)

* **Synchronous Serial**
  - Transfers a block of data at a time.
  - Required clock signal
  - **Example:** SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface), I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)

## Data Transmission

In data transmission, if the data can be transmitted and recieved, it is a duplex transmission. There are various transmission types based on this

**Simplex Transmission**: Data is transmitted in only one direction. So there will be only one TX and RX and connected by a single line.

**Half-Duplex Transmission**: Data is transmitted in two directions but only one way at a time. There are two TX and RX, and a single line connecting them.

**Full-Duplex Transmission**: Data is transmitted in both ways at the same time. There are two TX and RX, and two lines connect them.

## Baud Rate

Data transfer rate in serial communication is measured in terms of bits per second (bps). This is also called **Baud Rate**. 

> **Question:** 
Find the time taken to transmit 10 pages of text, each page with 100 words and each word with 25 characters. Assume the baud rate to be 115200 bps and each character holds 8 bits. The transmission has 1 start and stop bit. 

> **Solution:**
Total number of bits to be transmitted is
$$
  n = 10 . 100 . 25 . 8 + 2 = 200,002
$$
$$
  time = 200,002 / 115200 = 1.73
$$

So, it would take 1.73 ($$ \sqrt{3} $$) seconds to transmit !

**Note**: At baud rate greater than 76800, the cable length will need to be reduced. The higher baud rate, the more sensitive the cable becomes.
